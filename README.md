# CVs-analysis

This code installs and imports necessary libraries, reads a resume file and extracts skills from it using pyresparser library. It then cleans and preprocesses job descriptions from a CSV file, calculates the TF-IDF score for the skills extracted from the resume and uses it to find the closest matching job descriptions using nearest neighbors algorithm. The results are displayed in a dataframe containing the top 10 matching job positions along with their respective companies and locations.
